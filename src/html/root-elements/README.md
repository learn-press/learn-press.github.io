# Root elements

This is a non-standard category of elements.
There are three types of "root" elements:

* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`

In a valid HTML document, everything is:

* A descendent of the `<html>` element
* A descendent of either the `<head>` or the `<body>` elements.

In other words, every HTML document has this form:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```
