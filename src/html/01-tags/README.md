# Tags

In HTML, there are three types of tags:

* Start tag (sometimes called opening tag)
* End tag (sometimes called closing tag)
* Void tag (aka empty tag, aka self-closing tag)

(This categorization doesn't actually exist in the HTML standard,
but I created it this way because I think it helps with learning purposes)
