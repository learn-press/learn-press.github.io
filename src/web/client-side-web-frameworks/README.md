# Client side web frameworks (wip)

Client side web frameworks (aka, client side frameworks) are frameworks that run on browsers.

These are hosted in web servers for browsers to serve

## Difference with server side frameworks

These frameworks, along with the application code that uses them,
are executed on every browser on page visit.

This is unlike server side frameworks that typically run once on a single process.
