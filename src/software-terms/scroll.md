# scroll

In the context of UI, scroll is the shifting of the current UI [viewport](/software-terms/viewport/).

This is normally achieved by scrolling the mouse wheel, or pressing arrow keys or spacebar.

autoscroll coloquially means a scroll that is caused by software instead of user interaction.
