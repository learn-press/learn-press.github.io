# 1. Pick a preset

There are at least two options here. Only one can be selected.

* `default (babel, eslint)`
* `Manually select features` (and optionally save them as a preset)
* \<any other preset you have saved>

`default` is recommended for trying vue-cli for the first time.  
`Manually select features` is recommended for better setups.

Selecting `default` or a custom preset you had created,
asks no further questions and installs the app.

Selecting `Manually select features` asks more questions
that are described in the [following pages](./2-check-the-features/).
