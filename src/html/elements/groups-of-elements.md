# Groups of elements

There are 13 groups of HTML elements.

* Root elements
* Document metadata elements
* Content section elements
* Text content elements
* Inline text semantics elements (what a mouthful)
* Form elements
* Scripting elements
* Table content elements
* Image and multimedia elements
* Embedded content
* Demarcating elements
* Interactive elements
* Web components elements
* Obsolete elements (we won't teach these here)

There's no need to learn all the types and their elements at once, they are quite many.  
Some people get away with using just a few of these (sometimes for worse, for in ruining accessibility, sometimes because the project they work on does not use certain elements, like example multimedia elements).

However, learning all of them at some point is essential to writing good HTML documents.

*Note: the HTML standard doesn't use the term "groups" like I used it here.
In fact, it doesn't use any term to refer to this groupping criteria of elements.*

*Note: this categorization is slightly modified from the standard.  
The only difference is that I put the `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` in our non-canon
"Root elements" section, because I think it makes things easier to learn.*

*I also ordered these types and within them their elements
by my perceived level of importance and general usage of them.  
It is not the same ordering at the one used by the standard.*
