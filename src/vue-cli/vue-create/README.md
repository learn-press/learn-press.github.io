# `vue create [options] <app-name>`

Creates a vue application that uses `@vue/cli-service`.  
It is created in a new directory named `<app-name>` inside the current working directory.

This is the most important command of vue-cli.

By default, it runs an interactive cli to select certain features for the vue app.
