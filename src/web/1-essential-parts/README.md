# Essential parts of the web

These are the parts involved in the world wide web.

* [Browser](./browser/)
* [Address](./address/)
* [Web server](./web-server/)
* [Webpage](./web-page/)
* [Website](./web-site/)

The way these parts interact with each other is the following:

1. A user starts his browser of choice on his computer
2. The user enters an address of a website he likes on the browser's address bar
3. The browser downloads a webpage from the web server that hosts the website
4. The browser displays the downloaded webpage

(Keep in mind that website is the only part that is a concept instead of a more concrete thing)
