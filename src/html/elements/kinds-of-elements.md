# Kinds of elements (abridged version)

The standard defines [7 kinds of elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#elements-2).

For now, we'll only define two kinds of elements:

* Void elements, elements that can only be declared with a void tag
* Normal elements, elements that can only be declared with both a start and an end tag
