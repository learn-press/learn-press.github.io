# localhost

Conceptually, localhost refers to *this computer*.

In standard network implementations, `localhost` resolves to IP `127.0.0.1` in IPv4 protocol
and IP `::1` in IPv6 protocol.

Each of the aforementioned IP addresses is a
standard [loopback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback) address in modern systems.

Because of being a loopback interface, the `localhost` address can be used 
to access the current computer's network without using any network hardware.
