# Learn development

Hi, I'm zzyyxxw, an argentinian developer living in Brazil.

This is a docs style tutorial for different things I know about development.

At the bottom of this page is a list of rules that I follow when writing articles.


## Subjects

### Software in general
* [Software terms](./software-terms/)
* [SGML-like markup languages](./sgml-like-markup-langs)

### Web
* [Web in general](./web/)
* [HTML in depth](./html/)

### Vue
* [Vue, the web framework](./vue/)
* [vue-cli](./vue-cli/)

## Rules

Articles should be written in the least ambiguous way, by writing sentences that have the least amount of different interpretations possible, and by giving examples of the subjects.

Avoid unofficial synonyms.
Eg: ECMAScript has editions. And in a way, they could be also be referred to as versions. But the term versions should be avoided as it's not the official term and could cause unnecessary cognitive work.

Articles should be simple and preferrably a web page long.

The tree of a section should only have two levels: subjects with children articles about said subject.

It is not meant as a historically or extensively accurate reference.
It is meant to explain confusing things so as to accelerate getting into development.

It is also open to corrections for any factually wrong statements that could be found.

Sometimes, the implementation of a technical specification has the same name as that technical specification. While they are both closely related, they are not the same thing: for example, any implementation of a specification always has specific behaviour that isn't defined by the specification.  
Because of this, there should always be disambiguation between a technical specification and any implementation of it.

Humor is allowed on very specific situations.

Long sentences should be avoided.  
A long sentence would be a sentence that takes more than 2 lines of 80 characters.
