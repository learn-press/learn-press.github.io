# Learn development

Hi, I'm zzyyxxw, an argentinian developer living in Brazil.

This is a docs style tutorial for different things I know about development.

At the bottom of this page is a list of rules that I follow when writing articles.


## Subjects

### Software in general
* [Software terms](./software-terms/)

### Web
* [Web development in general](./web/)

### Vue
* [Vue, the web framework](./vue/)
* [vue-cli](./vue-cli/)

## Rules

Articles should be written in the least ambiguous way, by writing sentences that have the least amount of different interpretations possible, and by giving examples of the subjects.

Articles should be simple and should preferrably be a web page long.

The article tree should only have two levels: subjects with children articles about said subject.

The articles should be written 
It's also written in an opinionated way.

It is not meant as a historically or extensively accurate reference.

It is meant to explain confusing things so as to accelerate getting into development.

It is also open to corrections for any factually wrong statements that could be found.
