# `vue create` interactive feature selection

By default, running `vue create` enters an interactive mode that lets you select
the features that will be included in your vue-cli app.

The controls are:
* Arrow keys to move the selector
* Spacebar to toggle options on and off
* Enter/Return to accept the current selection/s

The first selection is [picking a preset](./1-pick-a-preset/)
