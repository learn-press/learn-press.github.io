# Attribute form

Based on the previous articles,
we can define the form of the attributes like this (in order):

* For each attribute:
  * A whitespace (` `)
  * The name of the attribute (in the first example `age`)
  * If the attribute has a value:
    * An equals sign `=`
    * A double quote `"`
    * The value of the attribute (any value defined by the user)
    * A double quote `"`
