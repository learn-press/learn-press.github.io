# declaration

The verb *to declare* is widely used and
essential to the vocabulary of developers.

It usually means to use or spawn some programming language constructs in our own code.

For example: declaring a variable.
```javascript
var something;
```

You can also declare a tag in an html document.
```html
<html>
</html>
```

Specifically in C, declaration is a concept but also a language feature (out of the scope of this document).
