# algorithm

An algorithm is a series of well defined steps that serve a specific purpose.

Such purpose is what they are usually categorized by.
For example, an algorithm that sorts things is a sorting algorithm.

(By sorting, we mean ordering a list by some criteria, for example, alphabetically).

Famous examples of sorting algorithms are quicksort and bubblesort.

Some algorithms are faster than others (as in, take less steps).

Some algorithms take more resources than others.

Algorithms are usually expressed in pseudocode.

This means that they aren't tied to any programming language.
