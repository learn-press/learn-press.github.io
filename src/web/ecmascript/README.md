# ECMAScript (aka ES)

ECMAScript (authored by [Ecma](/web/who-designs-the-web/ecma-international/)) is the standardized specification of JavaScript.

It standardizes Javascript to foster uniform behaviour between independent implementations of it.

It is expanding, as in, it is under periodic updates, which are called editions.

## Difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript

JavaScript is a programming language.  
ECMAScript is specification of JavaScript.

While JavaScript first appeared in December 1995, ECMAScript (with its first edition) appeared in 
June 1997.

Since then, ten new ECMAScript editions were published, each adding new features or fixing bugs from the previous edition.

## Another usage of the term ECMAScript

The term ECMAScript is sometimes used to refer to modern implementations of JavaScript, as in, a implementations that abides to the last edition of the specification of the same name.

I think it's a confusing usage (specially for beginners) because it shadows the original meaning for the standardized specification.

Because of this I prefer to use the expression "modern javascript" instead.
