## 2015 naming trend

In June 2015, the 6th ECMAScript edition was published, and with it, started for naming the editions:

This edition is referred to as ES2015 (ES for ECMAScript and 2015 because of the year it was published).  
But it's also referred to as ES6 (6 for being the 6th edition), albeit less officially.

That can cause some confusion, but they refer to the same edition.

Since this trend started, the editions have also been getting published on a yearly basis.

So there is:

* ES2015 (ES6)
* ES2016 (ES7)
* ES2017 (ES8)
* ES2018 (ES9)
* ES2019 (ES10)
