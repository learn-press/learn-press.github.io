# Elements

In HTML, you can't use anything as tag name (at least for now).
There is a finite list of tags you can use, and these are called elements.

In HTML, each element has specific qualities to it (defined by the standard)
and it usually represents something.
Eg: the `<img>` element represents an image.

In HTML, elements are identified by their tag.  
Eg: we don't refer to the `img` element, we refer to the `<img>` element.

In an HTML document, we also declare elements by using their tag.  
Eg: assume this is an html document and we use the `<html>` element:
```html
<html>
  ...
</html>
```
