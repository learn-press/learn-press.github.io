# 4. Use Babel alongside Typescript (typescript only)

This option is asking for the second time if you want Babel.

This option doesn't make a lot of sense, other than letting the user
know that babel will be involved in process of building typescript files.

In others words, it has the same effect as
selecting or deselecting babel in [check the features](./2-check-the-features/).
