# server side vs client side frameworks

In the web ecosystem, there are [server](/software-terms/client-server-model) side
[framework](/software-terms/framework/)
and client side frameworks.

## server side frameworks

Server side frameworks are frameworks that run on the server (duh).
They come in different flavours

Famous examples of this are: 
* laravel (PHP)
* ruby on rails (ruby)
* django (python)
* aspnet (c#)
* spring (java)
* express (nodejs)

## client side frameworks

Client side frameworks are frameworks that run on browsers.

These are hosted in web servers for browsers 

They are downloaded from a web server by a browser when it visits a page
and are executed in visiting browsers.

These frameworks, along with the application code that uses them,
are executed on every browser on page visit.

This is unlike server side frameworks that typically run once on a single process.
