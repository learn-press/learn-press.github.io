# Empty attribute

An empty attribute is an attribute that doesn't have a value.

Let's say our `<dog age="3"/>` from the previous example
can also have the empty attribute `invincible`.

We could it declare it like `<dog age="3" invincible/>`.

In HTML these are used for things that are either "on" or "off".  
The lack of their inclusion on the tag would mean "off"
while the inclusion would mean "on".

## Multiple attributes

As shown in the above example, tags can have multiple attributes
of any type combined as long as they are separated with a whitespace between themselves and the tag name.
