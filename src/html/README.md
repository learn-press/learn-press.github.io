# HTML

HTML is a foundational element of the Web.


It is a [markup language](/software-terms/markup-language/) for documents that are meant to be displayed by a web browser.

It is an SGML-like markup language, so I recommend reading
[that section](/sgml-like-markup-langs/) first.

The HTML standard is hosted at [html.spec.whatwg.org](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).
It's not recommended for beginners as it is very lengthy, although it's easier to read than other web standards.
