# Tags

Tags are the constructs used to annotate text,
like `<quote>` from the previous example.

Tags can also have attributes.
Let's assume the quote tag can have the `year` attribute.
And let's say that some hypothetical quote we know is from the year 1990.

Then let's declare said quote:

```html
<quote year="1990">
  ...here would be the quote...
</quote>
```
